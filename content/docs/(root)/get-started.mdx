## Installation

### Direct URL

Install components directly without any configuration:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add https://fab-ui.com/r/button.json
```

### Namespaced Registry

For a cleaner workflow, configure the fab-ui registry in your `components.json`:

```json title="components.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://shadcn.com/schema.json",
  "registries": {
    "fab-ui": "https://fab-ui.com/r/{name}.json"
  }
}
```

Then install components using short names:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add fab-ui/button
```

## Portals Setup

fab-ui uses portals for popup components like Dialog and Popover. To ensure these display above all page content, add an `isolation: isolate` style to your application root element:

```css title="globals.css"
.root {
  isolation: isolate;
}
```

This creates a separate stacking context, preventing `z-index` conflicts with other page styles.

## iOS 26+ Safari

Starting with iOS 26, Safari displays content beneath the UI chrome. Dialog backdrops and similar elements must use `position: absolute` instead of `position: fixed` to cover the visual viewport properly after scrolling. Add this style globally:

```css title="globals.css"
body {
  position: relative;
}
```

## Working with LLMs

fab-ui is built on Base UI. When working with AI assistants, you can reference the Base UI documentation in markdown format for accurate component APIs and patterns.

See [Base UI's llms.txt](https://base-ui.com/llms.txt) for AI-friendly documentation.
